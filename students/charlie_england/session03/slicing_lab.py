# Tasks
# Write some functions that take a sequence as an argument, and return a copy of that sequence:

# with the first and last items exchanged.
# with every other item removed.
# with the first 4 and the last 4 items removed, and then every other item in the remaining sequence.
# with the elements reversed (just with slicing).
# with the last third, then first third, then the middle third in the new order.
